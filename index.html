This web page demonstrates the sonic capabilities of the Web Audio Pulsar synthesizer. Parts 1 to 10 will demonstrate a different capability of the synth by explaining in detail each of its parameters. This will also include a button at every point that will play a sound file to demonstrate this parameter. This will feature screenshot figures of waveform and spectrogram analyses to provide a visual example of the parameters working. Because this synthesizer can be set up and programmed in many different ways, links will be provided to slightly different variations of the same synth. The only difference between them is  a few lines of code in the JavaScript document that have been edited.

<h5>Initial Preset</h5>
<p id="text1">Initial preset</p>
<p id="a">The audio file for this example is a square wave signal being enveloped by a Gaussian waveshape 
<br> at 3Hz. The timbre of the sound is a sine wave oscillator waveshaped to sound like a square.
<br> To hear this just click the On button.
<br>
<br> The steps are as follows:

      <h5>Infrasonic range to the continuous tone range</h5>
      <p id="text2">A train of pulsars going from the infrasonic range to the continuous tone range.
        <br> It starts at 3Hz and moves all the way up to 100Hz and back down to 0.3Hz. By moving the 
        <br> Infrasonic - Fundamental Frequency slider all the way to the right the train of 
        <br> pulsars will begin to fuse together into a continuous tone when it reaches 20Hz. The Audio Range - 
        <br> Fundamental Frequency slider is then moved all the way up to 100Hz where the frequency of 
        <br> the pulsaret envelope oscillator will start to modulate the frequency of the Pulsaret 
        <br> oscillator. The fundamental frequency is then lowered to a frequency of 0.3Hz. 
        <br>
        <br> The steps are as follows:
        <br>
        <b>Fundamental Frequency 0 to 20Hz - Infrasonic Range:</b> 3 to 20Hz
        <br>
        <b>Fundamental Frequency 20 to 100Hz - Audio Range</b> 20 to 100Hz
        <br>
        <b>Fundamental Frequency 20 to 100Hz - Audio Range</b> 100 to 20Hz
        <br>
        <b>Fundamental Frequency 0 to 20Hz - Infrasonic Range:</b> 20 to 0.3Hz
        <br>
        <br>
        <br> The picture below shows a spectrogram and waveform view of the sound file. It starts with 
        <br> "prickly" or "spiky" structure and gradually overtime they fuse together into a "block". 
        <br> This "block" area is where the individual pulsars are fused together into a tone in the middle 
        <br> of the picture. They are separated into individual pulsars again because the fundamental frequency 
        <br> is lowered back down again. <a href=https://infrasoniccluster2.github.io/MainPulsarSynthesizer/index.html>MainPulsarSynthesizer</a>

      <h5>Duty-Cycle Silence Ratio Slider  </h5>
      <p id="text3"> In this example you will hear the Duty-Cycle Silence Ratio Slider being moved from
        <br> 0.0 to -2.1. As the slider is slowly moved left the harmonics of the signal begin to change. This is 
        <br> because the duty-cycle length of the square wave signal is being shortened to a narrower and narrower 
        <br> length. <a href=https://infrasoniccluster2.github.io/MainPulsarSynthesizer/index.html>MainPulsarSynthesizer</a>
        <br>
        <br> The steps are as follows:
        <br>
        <b>Duty cycle-Silence Ratio:</b>slowly move in the left direction until the signal silent
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>

    <li>
      <h5>Duty-Cycle Silence Ratio Buffer Envelope</h5>
      <p id="text4">In this example the fundamental is decreased to 1.05 and the buffer for the envelope of 
the duty-cycle silence ratio is engaged by pressing the "Load Buffer" button and then the "Play Buffer" 
button. The harmonic content of the pulsarets are modulating at various rates because the Duty cycle-Silence Ratio Buffer Rate 
slider is being increased to its maximum level. The fundamental frequency is then increased to 15Hz so the 
envelope that is changing the duty cycle is much more noticeable. The rate of the buffer-envelope 
is then decreased to 0.002. By listening carefully there is a wavering sound from the duty-cycle silence ratio 
varying gradually over time. <a href=https://infrasoniccluster2.github.io/MainPulsarSynthesizer/index.html>MainPulsarSynthesizer</a>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br> The steps are as follows:
        <br>
        <b>Fundamental Frequency 0 to 20Hz - Infrasonic Range:</b> 3 to 1.05Hz
        <br>
        <b>Click:</b> Load Buffer and Play Buffer
        <br>
        <b>Duty cycle-Silence Ratio Envelope Rate - 0.002 to 0.3:</b> increase from 0.002 to 0.3
        <br>
        <b>Fundamental Frequency 0 to 20Hz - Infrasonic Range:</b> Increase to 15Hz
        <br>
        <b>Duty cycle-Silence Ratio Envelope Rate - 0.002 to 0.3:</b> increase from 0.3 to 0.002
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The image below shows a pulsaret from this sound file that shows its harmonic content cut off by the varying 
envelope. 
      </p>

    </li>
    
 
    <li>
      <h5>Duty-Cycle Silence Ratio Overlap</h5>
      <p id="text5"> This sound file demonstrates the overlap effect that happens when the varying duty cycle silence ratio 
is set at the edge of silencing the signal. In order for the synth to do so it must be programmed in a particular way. <a href=https://infrasoniccluster2.github.io/MainPulsarSynthesizer/index.html>MainPulsarSynthesizer</a>

        <br>
        <br> The steps are as follows:
        <br>
        <b>Duty cycle-Silence Ratio slider:</b> 1.8
        <br>
        <b>Click:</b> Load Buffer and then Play Buffer
        <br>
        <br> The buffer envelope will affect the pulsarets by either  muting them or cutting them off in mid waveform, as shown below
</p>

      <img src="Images/OverlapWaveform.png" width=110px id="img6">

      <p id="text6"> By moving the Duty cycle-Silence Ratio Envelope Rate slider, this will mute out some of the pulsarets in the train 
and will cut other pulsarets off in mid waveform. This produces a very rhythmic and percussive sound to the pulsar train. 
The fundamental frequency can also be increased to create a throbbing bundle of pulsars. By moving the main duty cycle silence 
ratio slider to 1.8 and playing around with the play back rate of the buffer and the fundamental frequency a lot of interesting rhythmic 
structures can be created.</p>

   <h5>Different Shapes of Duty-Cycle Silence Ratio Buffer Envelope</h5>
   
   <p id="text7">This example will demonstrate the different waveshapes that can be inserted into the buffer to modulate the duty cycle 
Silence Ratio. The waveshape used in the preset is a gaussian waveshape shown below in a waveform view:<br></p>
   
  
    <img src="Images/GaussianShape.png" width=610px id="img7"> <br>
   
   This is the shape that modulates the the DCOffsetGain node to affect the duty cycle. This shape can be played back at different rates by 
using the "Duty cycle-Silence Ratio Envelope Rate" sliders. The Gaussian shape can be heard in Demonstration 4. Any arbitrary shape can 
be used, however there are some popular "arbitrary" shapes used to emphasize different types of spectra and timbres. 
There are a few audio and image examples below: <br>
   <br>
 <p id="text8">  <img src="Images/line.png" width=610px id="img8"> <br>
    The figure above shows a line going from -1 to 1. This will modulate the 
DCOffsetGain between this range, by starting at -1 and moving all the 
way up to +1 and then looping back round to -1 again.<a href=https://infrasoniccluster2.github.io/LINE-/index.html>Pulsar Synth with a line shape in the buffer</a><br></p>
   <br>
   
   
   
  <p id="text9"> <img src="Images/tri.png" width=610px id="img9"> <br> 
  The figure above shows a variation on the line. The line starts at 0 
and moves up to +1 and instead of flicking back to 0 again it goes in the 
opposite direction back down to 0. This sound can be clearly heard in 
the example, it produces an interesting effect where the duty cycle is 
varying back and forth between the two extremes 0 and +1.<a href=https://infrasoniccluster2.github.io/Triangle-/index.html>Pulsar Synth with a triangle shape in the buffer</a><br></p>
  <br>
  
  
 <p id="text10"> <img src="Images/threelineseg.png" width=610px id="img10"> <br>
  The figure above shows a three stage line segment that is very much like 
the triangle where it rises from 0 to +1 and retuens back down again. In 
this example, when it reaches +1 it stays there for a length of time before 
decaying to 0 again. The audio demonstration is in two parts; 
the first part with a fundamental frequency of 3Hz and the second part at 20Hz.
This is to demonstrate the envelope in both the inframsonic and continuous 
tone range, the shape of this envelope is clearly heard in the continuous 
range. <a href=https://infrasoniccluster2.github.io/Three-Stage-Line-/index.html>Pulsar Synth with a Three-Stage-Line- shape in the buffer</a>
  </p>
  <br>
  
 <p id="text11"><img src="Images/expo.png" width=610px id="img11"> <br>
   This figure shows a shape with an exponential decay curve. This is very much 
like the triangle shape only it has a short attack and a longer decay time 
that moves smoothly downwards as opposed to a liner decay that goes straight
down.<a href=https://infrasoniccluster2.github.io/EXPO-/index.html>Pulsar Synth with an EXPO- shape in buffer</a><br></p>
   
   
   
   
   
  <p id="text12"><img src="Images/Noise.png" width=610px id="img12"> <br>
  This figure shows an extremely short burst of noise (about 1ms long). This is 
to modulate the DCOffsetGain node in a very chaotic way. By speeding up the 
playback of the buffer this will  produce a very erratic change in the duty 
cycle silence ratio between -0.8 and +0.8. By slowing it down this would 
create  a clearer sound but the duty cycle silence ratio will  vary back and 
forth in an uneven pattern. In the first part of this example the fundamental 
frequency is at 3Hz with the playback rate of the buffer at 0.3, this produces a 
noisy train of pulsars as the DCOffsetGain is modulating rapidly. In the second
part the fundamental frequency is at 12Hz with the playback rate of the buffer
at a low setting of 0.0001299. This produces a smoother varying duty cycle 
silence ratio.<a href=https://infrasoniccluster2.github.io/Noise/index.html>Pulsar Synth with a short snippet of white noise in the buffer</a> <br></p>
   <br>
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
  <p id="text12b">Any sound file can be used to modulate the duty cycle silence ratio. The user 
can even customize their own by using audio editors such as Audcaity and 
import them into the buffer to modulate the DCOffsetGain node.<br>
  <br>
  Below is a sound is a customized sound file:<br>
  
  <img src="Images/SquareBurstMaskWave.png" width=610px id="img12"><br>
  The figure above shows a screenshot of a waveform in Audacity. This represents a 
waveform where half of its period is at +1 and the other half is at -0.5. This 
was exported as a sound file and imported into the buffer. When using this 
file it will move the DCOffsetGain node to +1 for half of its period and back to -0.5
for the other half. This will modulate the duty cycle silence ratio as a type of
on/off switch for the pulsarets. This is very similar to a feature of 
Advanced Pulsar Synthesis, known as the burst masking ratio.
The feature is used to break up the pulsar train by deleting "individual pulsarets, 
leaving an interval of silence in their place" (Roads 2001, pp.149-150). This ratio can
be set by specifying exactly how many pulsarets to mask(delete) and how many to allow 
through. For this synthesizer the burst masking ratio is controlled using Duty cycle 
Silence Ratio Envelope Rate - 0.002 to 0.3 slider to set the length of time that the 
sound file will be at +1 and -0.5. In this example a Quasi-Gaussian curve was used as
the pulsaret envelope, along with a Gaussian arbitrary waveshape.<a href=https://infrasoniccluster2.github.io/Square-Burst-Mask/index.html>Pulsar Synth with a single cycle of a square wave in the buffer to produce a burst mask effect.</a><br>
  <b>The steps are as follows:</b><br>
  <b>Duty cycle-Silence Ratio:</b>-0.2<br>
  <b>Click:</b>Load Buffer and Play Buffer<br>
  <b>Duty cycle-Silence Ratio Envelope Rate - 0.002 to 0.3:</b>0.002<br>
  <b>Fundamental Frequency 0 to 20Hz - Infrasonic Range:</b>11Hz to 7Hz to 4hz<br>

<h5>Sound files used for pulsaret waveform</h5>
 <p id="text13">A sound file can be used instead of an oscillator for the pulsaret waveform. This allows for many different varieties of timbres
 as a  sound file of any length can be used. As the pulsaret envelope shapes this file over time the play back rate, volume and pitch 
can be changed to sculpt the sound. Sound files of short duration seem to be the most effective at creating pulsarets, although long sound files 
can be useful in creating interesting rhythmic structures. There are two examples below, one short file and one long file: For the short file a 100ms long snippet of a metallic ringing sound from the tines of a fork is enveloped by a Gaussian pulsaret envelope. In the 
sound file the fundamental is increased to about 12Hz than the play back rate is increased to about 3.1 and is then decreased to 0.6. 
The fundamental is then decreased to 1.7Hz, to achieve an enharmonic metallic swell.<a href=https://infrasoniccluster2.github.io/Sample-Pulsaret-Waveform-Metal/index.html>Pulsar Synth with a sound file as a pulsaret waveform: Metallic Ringing</a>
 <br>
<br> 
The steps are as follows:<br>
<b>Short Sound File</b> <br>
<b>Fundamental Frequency 0 to 20Hz - Infrasonic Range:</b> 3 - 12Hz <br>  
<b>Playback Rate of Pulsaret Waveform:</b> 0.0 to 3.1 to 0.6   <br>
<b>Fundamental Frequency 0 to 20Hz - Infrasonic Range:</b> 12 - 1.7Hz <br>  </p>
<br> 
<br> 

 <p id="text14">For the long sound file a recording of a voice was used. As speech is not a periodic waveform, this produced an uneven pulsar train. Certain words are cut out by the pulsaret envelope and others are enveloped which can be heard clearly in the pulsar train. The example starts with the sound file playing at a fast rate of 3.8 and the fundamental at 12Hz is then moved down to 5.6Hz. The playback rate of the pulsaret waveform buffer is then decreased to 1.2 which then reveals what the voice is saying, "I am not speaking English".  
<a href=https://infrasoniccluster2.github.io/Sample-Pulsaret-Waveform-Voice/index.html>Pulsar Synth with a sound file as a pulsaret waveform: Voice</a><br>
 
The steps are as follows: <br>
<b>Long Sound File</b> <br>
<b>Playback Rate of Pulsaret Waveform slider:</b> 0.0 to 3.8 <br>
<b>Fundamental Frequency 0 to 20Hz - Infrasonic Range:</b> 3Hz to 12Hz to 5.7Hz <br>

<h5>Arbirary waveshapes for the pulsaret waveform</h5>
 <p id="text15">The pulsaret waveform can be shaped in many different ways when connected to  the WaveShaperNode.  By using many different transfer functions this can affect the timbre and texture of the oscillator's signal. Below there are two types of transfer functions used.
</p>
 
 <p id="text16">Decaying multicycle sinusoud <br>
 <img src="Images/multicycle.png" width=210px id="img10"><br>
 Above is a figure of a multicycle sinusoid. The WaveShaperNode is sculpting a sine wave signal to create this shape for the pulsaret wave form. In the example you will hear the un-waveshaped signal, which is just a sine wave oscillator being enveloped by a gaussian curve, during the second half you will hear the waveshaped signal. A decaying Multicycle sinusoud is one of many arbitrary waveforms suggested by Curtis Roads in his book Microsound (2001,p.140)
 <a href=https://infrasoniccluster2.github.io/Decaying-multi-cycle-sinusoid-/index.html>Pulsar Synth with a Decaying-multi-cycle-sinusoid- as a pulsaret waveform</a></p><br>

 <br>
  <p id="text17">Multiple Squares <br>
  <img src="Images/squares.png" width=210px id="img11"><br>
 The figures shows a very jagged shape that the sine waveform is transformed to, this produces a hollow sounding square wave. <a href=https://infrasoniccluster2.github.io/Multiple-Squares-/index.html>Pulsar Synth with multiple squares as a pulsaret waveform</a></p><br>

  <h5>Arbirary waveshapes for the pulsaret envelope</h5>
 <p id="text18"> This is the part of the synth that forms the envelope for the pulsarets. This is done using the WaveShaperNode  from the Web Audio API. With the use of transfer functions we can form many arbitrary envelopes, such as the one  described by Roads (2001, p.141). These pulsaret envelopes affect the timbre and texture of the pulsarets because  of the shape applied to them. 
Below are  a number of  pulsaret envelopes:<br>
  <br>
  Sinc Function<br>
  <img src="Images/sinc.png" width=210px id="img12"><br>
  <br>
 The figure above shows a sinc function that is acting as the envelope for the same decaying multicycle sinusoud used in demonstration 8. In the recording the fundamnetal frequency is set at 8.5Hz.
<a href=https://infrasoniccluster2.github.io/SincEnv-DecMulCycleWave-/index.html>Pulsar Synth with a Sinc pulsaret envelope</a></p><br> 
  
  <p id="text19">Gaussian Function<br>
    <img src="Images/gaussianWave.png" width=210px id="img12"><br>
    
    <br>
    The figure above shows a Gaussian curve that is used to shape the pulsarets. The shape has a tendency to create  waveforms in such a way that it focuses most of the frequencies of its formant in a very condensed spot that is set by the duty cycle silence ratio. This is noted in (Roads 2001, p146). <br>
    <a href=https://infrasoniccluster2.github.io/GaussianEnv-DecMulCycleWave/index.html>Pulsar Synth with a Gaussian pulsaret envelope</a><br>
    In the next audio example the Gaussian envelope is shaping a decaying multicycle sinusoud, a waveform and spectrogram is shown below: <br> 
  
  
     <img src="Images/specGaussMulti.png" width=510px id="img13">
    <img src="Images/waveGaussMulti.png" width=510px id="img14"></p1><br>
    <br>
<p id="text20"> There is a second version of this which is the same pulsaret envelope but the WaveShaperNode for the decaying multicycle sinusoud is disengaged leaving just the clean sound of the sine wave from the pulsaret oscillator.        
   <img src="Images/specgaussClean.png" width=510px id="img15">
    <img src="Images/waveGaussClean.png" width=510px id="img16"><br>
    Note in the spectrogram figure a clean and clear separation between the pulsarets and the overall shape is very similar to the Gaussian curve above. <br>
    This can be achieved by clicking on the "Stop Arbitrary Shaper" button. <a href=https://infrasoniccluster2.github.io/GaussianEnv-DecMulCycleWave/index.html>Pulsar Synth with a Gaussian pulsaret envelope</a>

   <h5>Train Schedule</h5>
<p id="text21"> The figure below show the interface for the pulsar train scheduler.<br> 
<br>
     <img src="Images/trainschudule.png" width=310px id="img17"> <br>
     <br>
     This is insprired by the pulsar graph interface discussed by Roads in (2001, p.145). The is where rate of emission (fundamental frequency) of the pulsar trains can be automated over time. By moving the "Time Between Scheduled Points" slider this will equally space the points at which the fundamental frequnecy must reach in seconds. The three sliders below it will specify what the fundamental frequency must be at that point.<a href=https://infrasoniccluster2.github.io/TrainSchedule/index.html>Pulsar Synth with a parameter that automates the fundamental frequency</a>
     <br>
     <br>
     Below an example displays the required set up:<br>
     <br>
     <b>Time Between Scheduled Points:</b> 8.5 seconds<br>
     <b>Fundamental frequency for Point 1:</b> 1.5 <br>
     <b>Fundamental frequency for Point 2:</b> 34.12 <br>
     <b>Fundamental frequency for Point 3:</b> 8.6 <br>
